            <p>Hello! I’m KONAKANTI AKHILA, a motivated and detail-oriented B.Tech graduate specializing in Computer Science (IoT) from GPCET, Kurnool. With a strong foundation in core technologies like Java, HTML, Python, and SQL, I am passionate about building efficient and innovative solutions. My educational journey, marked by a CGPA of 8.00, has equipped me with not only technical skills but also essential soft skills such as teamwork and problem-solving. In my spare time, I enjoy playing kabaddi and dancing, which helps me stay active and balanced. I look forward to connecting and exploring opportunities in the tech world!</p>
